Remember your ideas

Ideabox is an application that allows you to keep track of all your ideas. Ideabox 
was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and localStorage. LocalStorage will 
store ideas for as long as you would like. However the stored ideas are specific to
the device being used and the use of localStorage may not be supported in all browsers
at this time.
